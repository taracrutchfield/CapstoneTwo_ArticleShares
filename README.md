# Capstone II: Mashable Article Popularity
### Springboard - Data Science Career Track 

Repository contains all files used to analyze the shares of Mashable articles in order to determine what factors play into article popularity. The file `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv` was found using the [University of California, Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and was created by [Kelwin Fernandes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283510525_A_Proactive_Intelligent_Decision_Support_System_for_Predicting_the_Popularity_of_Online_News) for a study on online news popularity done at the University of Porto, Portugal. 

Throughout analysis, I was able to determine that the most important features that affect article popularity were its connection to other popular articles either through direct references or similar keywords. While I was able to create a model with 91% accuracy, the model had an extremely low recall and failed to identify a majority of the Popular articles.
